# wide-awake
WideAwake is a windows application that will keep your PC running and stop the screen from suddenly dimming. Some businesses don't allow employees to alter their PCs' power-saving settings, so you might be stuck with, say, a 30-minute time-out. If only you could hire an intern to jiggle the mouse every few minutes! Well .. you are so lucky as WideAwake would do that for you. just run the program and it will move the mouse for you.

# How it works
WideAwake will automatically move the mouse one pixel up and one pixel down, simulating a human setting on the machine. This movement will stop the PC from moving into the sleep mode or the battery saving mode.

If you are using a chat tool like Skype for business, it will show you as online/active all the time.

The mouse movement is barely noticeable, however, if you are watching a video, the video controls might always show up on the screen due to the constant mouse movement.

# No installation required
Starting the application is as simple as running the exe file.

# How to exit
Just press the ESC button, and the program will automatically exit.
